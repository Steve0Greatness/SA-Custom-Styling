# Scratch Addons Custom Styling

This userstyle is incredibly basic, simply changing the styling of Certain webpages to be more inline with the original version of them... because I like it better.

Please note: this userstyle is made for usage with [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com)' *Scratch 2.0 â†’ 3.0*(<code title="The internal name for the addon.">scratchr2</code>). No need to change the setting of that addon, as this is designed around the defaults. The userstyle also adapts to the colors you've set in *Website dark mode and customizable colors*(<code title="The internal name for the addon.">dark-www</code>)

**READ BEFORE INSTALLING.** When the userstyle is installed, you may not like the color of the forums header, you can change that by going into the userstyle's settings and changing Forum Header Color to whatever color you want.
